# Set

[Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)) is a game I enjoy, but there’s a somewhat high barrier to entry for new players:

- It’s awkward to explain
- It’s frustratingly difficult the first few times (and can turn people off from the game completely)

I made two related web apps to help with this:

- A tutorial that explains the game in an interactive, bite-sized way
- A single-player implementation with simplified practice modes that are much more reasonable and engaging for new players
